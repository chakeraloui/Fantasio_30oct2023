\item{chr}{the chromosome number from which to plot ROH}

\item{outfile}{the name of the plot}

\item{listid}{a vector containing the family id follow by the individual id}

\item{regions}{a matrix containing the value to ve highlighted in the plot}

\value{
This function returns a plot of the HBDsegments for a specific chromosome
}
\description{
This function is used to plot HBDsegments for a chromosome using an ROH file
}
\details{
Use this function when you want to use an ROH file to plot your HBDsegments for a specific chromosome.

Two unit are accepted : "Bases" or "cM".

If you use the regions options make sure to pass a matrix containing one line per region to be highlighted with in each line :
